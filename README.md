## FULL-STACK DEVELOPER

With over eight years of experience in the finance industry, including working for top American banks in the investment sector and trading various markets independently, I developed a strong interest in trading diverse assets like stocks, crypto, and futures. This passion pushed me to learn programming so I could test and automate my trading ideas. The ability to quickly validate my strategies using code made me fall in love with programming.

I am highly motivated, self-driven, and detail-oriented.
